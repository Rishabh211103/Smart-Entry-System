It is a suite of short, carefully prepared talks, demonstrations and performances that are idea-focused, covering a wide range of disciplines to foster learning, inspiration and wonder along with simultaneously provoking conversations that matter. It is organized by volunteers from the local community, and just like TED events, it lacks any commercial, religious or political agenda. All TEDx events present multiple issues and a diversity of voices from a plethora of topics. After all, whatâ€™s the fun without a little variety?                         '}
